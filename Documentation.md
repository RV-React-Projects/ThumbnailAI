## üõ†Ô∏è Project Approach

### 1. **Problem Analysis & Research**

**Initial Challenge:**
We started by understanding the real pain points content creators face:
- Time consumption (2-4 hours per thumbnail)
- High cost of design tools ($20-50/month)
- Lack of design expertise
- Inconsistent branding

**Research Phase:**
- Analyzed popular YouTube thumbnails across different niches
- Studied what makes thumbnails click-worthy
- Researched AI image generation capabilities
- Evaluated different AI models and APIs

### 2. **Solution Design**

**Core Concept:**
Instead of traditional design tools, use AI to generate thumbnails based on simple text descriptions.

**Key Decisions:**
- **AI Model Choice**: Selected Hugging Face's FLUX.1-schnell for speed and quality
- **User Interface**: Single-page application for seamless experience
- **Input Method**: Simple form (title + description + theme) rather than complex design tools
- **Enhancement Feature**: AI-powered title correction and improvement

### 3. **Architecture Planning**

**Frontend Strategy:**
- Next.js for server-side rendering and performance
- Component-based architecture for reusability
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop
